## Prerequisites

If you would like to follow along hands-on during the Workshop, please do the following (20 minutes). All software is free.

1. **GitHub username**
    - Create a GitHub account (if you donâ€™t already have one) at <https://github.com>. Follow optional [advice on choosing your username](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
    - Please [provide your GitHub username here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOd0RhzEo5sFq_NgjZJa0C6cmaicTOjPS290iCbHbFTI-8zg/viewform?usp=sf_link); this will allow us to add you to the cloud hackathon workspace.
    - Remember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the workshop!
1. **Earthdata Login account** 
    - Create an Earthdata Login account (if you don't already have one) at <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov>
    - Remember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the workshop!
1. **Zoom**
    -  Be prepared to call into Zoom using the link provided in the Slack `2021-nasacloudhack-general` Channel. 
1. **Get comfortable** 
    - Consider your computer set-up in advance, including an external monitor if possible. You will be following along in Jupyter Hub on your own computer while also watching an instructor live-code over Zoom (or equivalent), and will also want quick-access to Slack to ask for help and follow links.

## Getting help

We will use Zoom Chat as our main channel for help. Please use this to post questions and request a breakout room.
