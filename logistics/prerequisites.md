    - We will ask for your username at the beginning of the workshop
    - Remember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the workshop!

## Getting help

We will use Zoom Chat and Google Doc notes as our main channels for help. Please use Zoom Chat to post questions, direct helpers to any screenshots you've pasted or conversations in the Google Doc, and request a breakout room.
