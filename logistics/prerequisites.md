## Prerequisites

If you would like to follow along hands-on during the Workshop, please do the following (20 minutes). All software or accounts are free.

1. **GitHub username**
    - Create a GitHub account (if you donâ€™t already have one) at <https://github.com>. Follow optional [advice on choosing your username](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
    - Please [provide your GitHub username here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSSYUh66U6CcpoevkMoMyS-8qQ86gae73IdiEqD7FKTQWA9Q/viewform?usp=sf_link); this will allow us to add you to the cloud hackathon workspace.
    - Remember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the workshop!
1. **Earthdata Login account** 
    - Create an Earthdata Login account (if you don't already have one) at <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov>
    - Remember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the workshop!
1. **Get comfortable** 
    - Consider your computer set-up in advance, including an external monitor if possible. You can follow along in Jupyter Hub on your own computer while also watching an instructor demo over Zoom (or equivalent), and will also want quick-access to Slack to ask for help and follow links.

## Getting help

We will use Zoom Chat as our main channel for help. Please use this to post questions and request a breakout room.
