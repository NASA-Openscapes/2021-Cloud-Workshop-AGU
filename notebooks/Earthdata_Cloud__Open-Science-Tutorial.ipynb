    "As one of the largest Earth science data repositories, the NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) archives and freely distributes roughly 32 petabytes of satellite, aircraft, and field data, supporting a diverse Earth science user community. These data volumes continue to grow as new, high-resolution remote sensing missions launch in the coming years, requiring new data management approaches to support and reduce barriers to scientific research. To address these needs and advance open science data systems and the data users they support, NASA EOSDIS data and associated discovery and access tools are migrating to the cloud. The EOSDIS Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) are working collaboratively to support researchers as they migrate to a cloud-based data workflow, developing educational materials to teach these new skills using open source programming languages and libraries. This tutorial will walk through some of these new supporting resource materials on how to discover, access, and work with NASA Earthdata in the cloud, highlighting efficient and reproducible pathways to scientific analysis made possible by the cloud and open source technologies.\n",
